🌱 Paradise Nursery – React Shopping App

Welcome to Paradise Nursery, a modern React front-end application I built as my final project for the Developing Front-End Apps with React course.

This project is more than just an assignment — I wanted it to feel futuristic, clean, and professional, something I’d be proud to share on my GitHub portfolio.

🚀 Overview

Paradise Nursery is a shopping application that allows users to:

Browse a collection of houseplants

Add plants to a shopping cart

Adjust quantities and view the total cost before checkout

The app is built with React + Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS for a sleek, responsive, and modern design.

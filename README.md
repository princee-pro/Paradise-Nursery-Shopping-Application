Paradise Nursery – React Shopping App

This is my final project for the course Developing Front-End Apps with React.
I wanted to take the requirements and push them further by making the app modern, futuristic, and portfolio-ready.

The app is built with React (Vite), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn-ui.

🚀 What this app does

A Landing Page with a background image, company name, short intro, and a glowing Get Started button.

A Product Listing Page where you can browse plants organized by categories. Each plant has an image, name, price, description, and an Add to Cart button.

A Shopping Cart Page that lets you:

See items added

Increase/decrease quantities

Remove items

View subtotal, total cost, and number of items

Checkout

The cart is fully dynamic and updates instantly across the app.

🛠️ Tech Stack

🎨 Tailwind CSS + shadcn-ui (for a clean and modern UI)
